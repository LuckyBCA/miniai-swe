Here is a comprehensive list of problems and their solutions that occurred during the video tutorial, which should help you resolve similar issues:

*   **Node.js Version Incompatibility**:
    *   **Problem**: If your Node.js version is lower than `18.18`, or if running `node -v`, `npm -v`, or `npx -v` commands results in errors.
    *   **Solution**: **Upgrade or reinstall Node.js** by visiting the official Node.js website.

*   **Next.js Installation Breaking Changes**:
    *   **Problem**: Using `@latest` for `create-next-app` might introduce breaking changes if you're following an older tutorial version.
    *   **Solution**: **Specify the exact Next.js version** used in the tutorial (e.g., `15.3.4`) to avoid unforeseen breaking changes. The presenter chose this approach to ensure consistency for viewers watching later.

*   **Missing Tailwind Config File (Tailwind v4)**:
    *   **Problem**: Tailwind config file is missing.
    *   **Solution**: This is **expected behaviour with Tailwind CSS v4**, as it no longer introduces a `tailwind.config` file within the source folder.

*   **Shadcn UI `init` or `add` Command Prompts**:
    *   **Problem**: Being prompted to install during Shadcn UI initialization or component addition.
    *   **Solution**: You can **select 'yes'** if prompted to install dependencies. If you encounter errors or decisions, selecting `legacy-peer-deps` or `force` might help, though the presenter noted it should generally work out of the box with the specified versions.

*   **Next.js Page Component Not Found (Default Export)**:
    *   **Problem**: The application cannot find a page component.
    *   **Solution**: Ensure your page components **use a default export** (e.g., `export default function Page() { ... }`). The name of the component itself does not matter, but it cannot use reserved keywords.

*   **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense Not Working (Missing VS Code Extension)**:
    *   **Problem**: Not seeing colour icons or inner CSS on hovering over Tailwind classes in VS Code.
    *   **Solution**: **Install the Tailwind CSS IntelliSense package** in VS Code.

*   **Uncommitted Files After Shadcn UI Installation**:
    *   **Problem**: A large number of uncommitted files after adding all Shadcn UI components.
    *   **Solution**: This is a **normal result of the installation process**, indicating many new components have been added to your project. These changes need to be staged and committed in your Git workflow.

*   **Prisma Database Schema Drift / Migration Issues**:
    *   **Problem**: Database schema is not in sync with the migration history, often after manual changes to the Prisma schema or deletion of migration files.
    *   **Solution**: In development, you can **run `npx prisma migrate reset`** to clear the entire database and its migration history. If this fails, a brute-force method is to **create a new PostgreSQL database** (e.g., via Neon) and update the `DATABASE_URL` in your environment.

*   **Prisma Studio Syntax Highlighting Missing**:
    *   **Problem**: Not seeing syntax highlighting in Prisma schema files.
    *   **Solution**: **Install the Prisma extension** in your IDE (e.g., VS Code).

*   **Next.js Hot Reload Causing Prisma Client Issues**:
    *   **Problem**: A warning in the terminal about new Prisma clients being initialised on every hot reload, leading to problems.
    *   **Solution**: Store the Prisma client instance **in a global variable** (e.g., `globalThis.prisma`) because global objects are not affected by hot reload.

*   **tRPC Import Alias Errors**:
    *   **Problem**: Errors with import aliases (e.g., `~`) in tRPC setup files.
    *   **Solution**: **Switch the import alias to an `@` sign** (e.g., `@/trpc/init`).

*   **SuperJSON Serialization Errors**:
    *   **Problem**: Errors related to SuperJSON, indicating it's not fully enabled for serialization.
    *   **Solution**: **Enable SuperJSON transformer in `client.tsx` and `init.ts`** to handle complex object serialization/deserialization when passing props between server and client components.

*   **tRPC Type `any` Everywhere**:
    *   **Problem**: Seeing `any` type for everything when hovering over tRPC queries/inputs.
    *   **Solution**:
        *   Ensure `strict: true` is enabled in `tsconfig.json`.
        *   Verify your editor is using the proper TypeScript version.
        *   **Add specific TypeScript settings to VS Code's `settings.json`** (e.g., `javascript.suggestionActions.enabled`, `typescript.suggestionActions.enabled`, `editor.codeActionsOnSave` for `source.organizeImports`, `source.fixAll.eslint`).
        *   **Reload the VS Code window** (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P then "Reload Window") to restart the TypeScript server.

*   **Using Hooks in Server Components**:
    *   **Problem**: App breaks when using React hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`) or browser APIs in a server component.
    *   **Solution**: **Add `'use client'` directive at the top of the file** to turn it into a client component.

*   **Application Hanging/Freezing During Development**:
    *   **Problem**: The application freezes or hangs on loading during development.
    *   **Solution**: **Shut down and restart both your Next.js development server (`npm run dev`) and the Ingest developer server (`npx ingest-cli@latest dev`)**. The presenter notes this should not happen in the actual deployed application.

*   **Ingest Developer Server 404s**:
    *   **Problem**: Ingest developer server shows a bunch of 404 errors.
    *   **Solution**: This indicates the Ingest server is trying to find your Ingest initialization but hasn't yet. **Create the Ingest client (`client.ts`) and API endpoint (`route.ts`)** as per documentation to resolve this.

*   **Ingest Function Renaming Mismatch**:
    *   **Problem**: Changing an Ingest function ID/name (e.g., from `helloWorld` to `codeAgent`) causes issues.
    *   **Solution**: When renaming an Ingest function, **ensure all references in your tRPC procedures (`messages/server/procedures.ts`) and API routes (`app/api/ingest/route.ts`) are updated** to match the new ID/name.

*   **AI Model Rate Limits (Anthropic)**:
    *   **Problem**: Hitting strict rate limits with certain AI models (e.g., Anthropic Claude), leading to long reset times (over 24 hours).
    *   **Solution**: The presenter **recommends OpenAI (specifically GPT-4.1)** due to more reasonable rate limits (around 2-second resets). If sticking with Anthropic, you might need to change the model or create a new organisation/account.

*   **Missing OpenAI/E2B API Keys**:
    *   **Problem**: AI agent or E2B sandbox creation fails due to missing API keys.
    *   **Solution**: **Add the necessary environment variables** (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `E2B_API_KEY`) to your `.env` file with the correct keys obtained from your provider dashboards. Ensure the environment variable names match what the models are looking for.

*   **AI Agent Output Inconsistency/Hallucination (Prompts)**:
    *   **Problem**: AI agent hallucinates or makes mistakes (e.g., forgets `use client` directive, uses incorrect packages, doesn't understand context well).
    *   **Solution**:
        *   **Refine the system prompt**: Add more specific and strict rules (e.g., "always add `use client` to the top, the first line of `app/page.tsx`"). The presenter iteratively refined their prompt by observing AI failures.
        *   **Use deeper instructions**: For Docker templates, instruct AI where the Next.js application is located to prevent it from searching in wrong directories.
        *   **Experiment with different AI models**: Some models are better at code generation (e.g., Claude Sonnet 3.5 is highly reliable, but OpenAI GPT-4.1 is a good balance).
        *   **Iterative refinement**: Allow users to instruct the AI after a failure (e.g., "You forgot to add `use client`, please fix it").

*   **Docker Not Running During E2B Template Build**:
    *   **Problem**: `e2b template build` command fails with errors indicating Docker is not running.
    *   **Solution**: **Ensure Docker Desktop (or an alternative like Orbstack) is installed and actively running** on your system. You might also need the Docker CLI installed and accessible from your terminal.

*   **E2B Docker Template Build Blocked by User Input**:
    *   **Problem**: The Docker build process hangs because commands (like `create-next-app` or `shadcn-ui init`) are waiting for user input in the container.
    *   **Solution**: **Add `--yes` or `-y` flag to CLI commands** within the Dockerfile to automatically agree to all prompts and prevent the terminal from hanging (e.g., `npx --yes create-next-app`, `shadcn-ui init --yes`).

*   **E2B Docker Template Build Failure (File Movement)**:
    *   **Problem**: The command to move content from the newly created Next.js app folder into the home user directory fails.
    *   **Solution**: This is often due to missing `--yes` flags on previous commands, causing them to hang. **Ensure all interactive commands in the Dockerfile have the `--yes` flag**.

*   **E2B Sandbox Not Found After 5 Minutes**:
    *   **Problem**: Live preview URLs for generated sandboxes expire and show a "sandbox wasn't found" error after a default of 5 minutes.
    *   **Solution**: **Increase the sandbox timeout parameter** when creating the sandbox (e.g., using `sandbox.setTimeout(milliseconds)`). Hobby users can extend it up to 1 hour (e.g., 30 minutes for presentations), while Pro users can extend it up to 24 hours. Be mindful that longer timeouts consume more credits.

*   **E2B Template Visibility (Private vs. Public)**:
    *   **Problem**: Difficulty connecting to a private E2B template, or needing to change its visibility.
    *   **Solution**: You can **publish your template using `e2b template publish`** for easier access (though this makes it publicly accessible by ID, so share cautiously). To make it private again, **use `e2b template unpublish`**. The presenter noted that they initially experienced problems with private templates, but later it worked.

*   **Navbar Scroll Transparency Issue**:
    *   **Problem**: The navbar remains transparent when scrolling, causing readability issues.
    *   **Solution**: Implement a `useScroll` hook to **dynamically change the navbar's background and border** based on scroll position (e.g., when `window.scrollY` exceeds a threshold).

*   **Messages Container Auto-Scrolling and Fragment Selection Conflicts**:
    *   **Problem**: Initial auto-scroll to the bottom of messages conflicts with manual fragment selection, or `refetchInterval` causes active fragment to reset.
    *   **Solution**: **Implement `lastAssistantMessageIdRef`** to store the ID of the last automatically selected assistant message. The `useEffect` will then only update the active fragment if a *new* assistant message arrives, preserving the user's manual selection otherwise.
    *   The `refetchInterval` for messages can be temporarily commented out or set to a low value (e.g., 2 seconds) for a better dev experience, as tRPC's Tanstack Query polling is already highly optimized and cache-aware.

*   **UI Elements Clipping with Overflow**:
    *   **Problem**: Text or content visibly clips (is cut off) when overflowing in certain UI elements.
    *   **Solution**: Add a **gradient shadow layer** at the top/bottom of the overflowing container to create a "fade-to-fog" effect, making the clipping less obvious. For code preview, ensure the tabs content has `min-h-0` class for proper scrolling.

*   **Unclear Icon Functionality (UI/UX)**:
    *   **Problem**: Icons in the UI (e.g., external link, copy, refresh) are not immediately clear to the user.
    *   **Solution**: **Implement a reusable `Hint` component (tooltip)** that wraps buttons/icons and displays descriptive text on hover.

*   **File Explorer Tree View Selection Not Working**:
    *   **Problem**: Clicking on files in the file explorer tree view does not update the selected file for display.
    *   **Solution**: The issue was a **hardcoded name in `currentPath` calculation within the `tree` component** that should have been dynamic. Ensure `name` is properly passed within curly brackets in template literals.

*   **Clerk Authentication Redirection Issues**:
    *   **Problem**: Users are always redirected to the sign-in page, or specific API routes are inaccessible after Clerk middleware setup.
    *   **Solution**: **Update `middleware.ts` to include public routes** (e.g., `/`, `/pricing`, `/api/ingest`, `/api/trpc/...`) that should be accessible without authentication. Clerk environment variables for sign-in/sign-up URLs and fallbacks should also be correctly set in `.env`.

*   **Clerk Theming/Dark Mode Integration**:
    *   **Problem**: Clerk components (e.g., User Button, Sign In/Up pages) don't automatically adapt to the application's dark mode.
    *   **Solution**:
        *   **Install `@clerk/themes` package**.
        *   **Create a `useCurrentTheme` hook** to reliably get the current theme (light/dark) considering system preference.
        *   **Apply `baseTheme: dark` from `@clerk/themes`** to Clerk component `appearance` props based on the `currentTheme`.
        *   **Set Clerk `appearance.variables.colorPrimary`** in `_app.tsx` or main layout to match your app's primary theme color.

*   **Insufficient Credits Error / Redirection**:
    *   **Problem**: Users run out of credits and need to be informed and redirected to the pricing page.
    *   **Solution**:
        *   **Implement `consumeCredits` function** within protected tRPC procedures (e.g., `messages.create`, `projects.create`).
        *   **Wrap credit consumption in a `try...catch` block**. If the `consumeCredits` call throws a "too many requests" error, **throw a tRPC error with code `TOO_MANY_REQUESTS`**.
        *   On the frontend, in the `onError` callback of the mutation, **check for this specific error code (`TOO_MANY_REQUESTS`) and redirect the user to the `/pricing` page**.

*   **Usage Status Not Updating/Displaying**:
    *   **Problem**: The displayed remaining credits (`usage` component) do not update automatically after an action.
    *   **Solution**: After successfully consuming credits or creating a project/message, **invalidate the `trpc.usage.status` query** using `queryClient.invalidateQueries(trpc.usage.status.queryOptions())` to force a refetch and update the UI.

*   **Agent Memory/Conversation Context Loss**:
    *   **Problem**: The AI agent does not remember previous conversations or generated content, treating each message as a new request.
    *   **Solution**:
        *   **Fetch previous messages from the database** (`prisma.message.findMany`) filtered by `projectId` and sorted by `createdAt` (descending).
        *   **Format these messages into a structure expected by Ingest Agent Kit** (`type Message from '@ingest-kit/agent'` with `role` and `content`).
        *   **Pass these `formattedMessages` into the `defaultState.messages`** when creating the Ingest Agent Kit network.
        *   **Limit the message history** (e.g., to the last 5 messages) and **reverse the order** (if fetched descending) to ensure the AI understands the latest context. This helps reduce confusion for the model.

*   **Inconsistent AI Generated Summaries/Titles**:
    *   **Problem**: AI-generated responses (summaries, fragment titles) are not consistent or well-formatted.
    *   **Solution**: **Introduce separate, smaller AI agents (e.g., `fragmentTitleGenerator`, `responseGenerator`)** with specific system prompts (e.g., `fragmentTitlePrompt`, `responsePrompt`) and potentially cheaper AI models to generate these outputs. Implement a utility function (`parseAgentOutput`) to safely extract content from these agents' responses.

*   **Errors in Date Formatting Causing UI Breaks**:
    *   **Problem**: Invalid dates or unexpected values in `millisecondsBeforeNextRefresh` can cause the `formatDuration` function (from `date-fns`) to throw errors and break the entire page.
    *   **Solution**: **Wrap the date formatting logic within a `useMemo` hook and a `try...catch` block**. In case of an error, return a fallback string (e.g., "unknown" or "soon") instead of letting the entire component crash.

*   **Vercel Deployment Failures (Linting)**:
    *   **Problem**: Initial Vercel deployments fail, often due to linting errors in generated files.
    *   **Solution**:
        *   **Add a `postinstall` script to `package.json`**: `prisma generate` to ensure Prisma client is generated during deployment.
        *   **Configure ESLint to ignore the generated folder**: In `eslint.config.mjs`, add `**\/generated` to the `ignores` array. This prevents ESLint from checking auto-generated files that might not conform to your linting rules.
        *   (Less recommended alternative): In `next.config.js`, set `eslint.ignoreDuringBuilds: true` to disable linting during the build process entirely.

*   **Deployed App Not Using Correct App URL**:
    *   **Problem**: The deployed application still attempts to load local URLs (e.g., `localhost:3000`) for API calls or previews.
    *   **Solution**: After the initial deployment, **obtain your Vercel app's live URL** (from the Vercel dashboard). Then, **update the `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` environment variable in Vercel settings** with this new URL and **redeploy the application**.

*   **Ingest Not Communicating with Deployed Vercel Project**:
    *   **Problem**: Background jobs triggered from the deployed app fail to run on Ingest, indicating a communication issue.
    *   **Solution**:
        *   **Connect your Vercel project to Ingest** via Ingest's integrations dashboard.
        *   **Configure "Deployment Protection Bypass" in Vercel settings** for your project. Add a new secret (value can be empty).
        *   **Copy the "Bypass Secret" from Vercel and paste it into the "Deployment Protection Key" field in Ingest's Vercel integration settings** for your project. This allows Ingest to securely communicate with your protected Vercel application.
        *   Redeploying the Vercel project after these steps is often a good measure, although in some cases, it might work immediately.

*   **Global Error Handling Not Catching All Errors**:
    *   **Problem**: Ugly, unhandled errors visible to the user when components fail, even with a global `error.tsx`.
    *   **Solution**: Implement **`react-error-boundary` (or Next.js's `error.tsx`) at segment-level (around `Suspense` components)** to catch errors from individual parts of the UI. The global `app/error.tsx` serves as the *last line of defence* for unhandled errors, preventing the entire application from crashing visually.

By addressing these common problems and applying the provided solutions, you should be able to build and deploy your AI-powered application effectively.
